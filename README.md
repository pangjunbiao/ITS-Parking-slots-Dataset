# ITS-Parking-slots-Dataset
The dataset consists of the four parts: 1) the manually collected GPS coordinates for the parking spots; 2) the ID of the road segments where the parking spots should live on; 3) the GPS points of the road segments; and 4) the attributes (e.g., intersection, road direction) of the road segments.
